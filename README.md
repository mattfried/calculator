Calculator App

https://mattfried.github.io/calculator/

My own creation of a basic calculator web app.

I used JavaScript to set the values of each number and operator, and then evaluate the users inputs in order to output the mathematical solution no matter what combination of valid inputs are provided. Additional functions and 'if' statements were added to change the font size of the output depending on the length of its displayed number.

The output screen is coded so that it only displays the current input number or operator rather than displaying the entire input chain.

In order to achieve a responsive web app, media queries were used to accommodate various screen and device sizes, for both portrait and landscape orientations.
